## ✅ Critical Principles

### 1. Bootstrap First
- Minimize costs (free tiers, < $30/month)
- Generate consulting revenue BEFORE having users
- Cover costs from day 1 without funding

### 2. Service → Product → Data
- 0-500 users: Focus on services (consulting, workshops)
- 500-5,000 users: Transition to product revenue (premium, ads)
- 5,000+ users: Add data revenue (B2B insights)

### 3. Privacy First
- Self-hosted always free and unlimited
- Opt-in data collection only
- No selling personal user data (illegal and unethical)
- Only aggregate, anonymized metadata (100+ users minimum)

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
- 200 engaged users > 2,000 inactive users
- Know your first 100 users personally
- Word-of-mouth is everything at small scale

### 5. Persistence Wins
- Most startups take 12-24 months to gain traction
- Growth is slow, then exponential
- Keep shipping, keep marketing, keep learning

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Don't Do This:
❌ Wait until 10,000 users to monetize  
❌ Try to sell personal user data (illegal)  
❌ Over-engineer before product-market fit  
❌ Paid ads before understanding your funnel  
❌ Build features users don't want  
❌ Ignore costs until it's too late  
❌ Give up in months 2-4 (the valley of despair)  

### Do This Instead:
✅ Monetize from day 1 (consulting + pre-sales)  
✅ Only sell aggregated, anonymized metadata (at scale)  
✅ Keep it simple and iterate fast  
✅ Organic growth first, paid later  
✅ Talk to users obsessively  
✅ Use free tiers and bootstrap  
✅ Push through the hard parts
